# Divide and Conquer

Break the problem into several subproblems that are similar to the original proble but smaller in size, solve the subproblems recursively, and then combine these solutions to create a solution to the original problem.

1. **Divide** the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.

2. **Conquer** subproblems by solving them recursively. If the subproblem sizes are small enough, however, just solve the subproblems in a straightforward manner.

3. **Combine** solutions to subproblems into the solution for the original problem.
