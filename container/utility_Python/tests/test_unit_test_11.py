"""
* use patch() as a context manager rather than a decorator

same test as test_unit_test_10.py with different form (patch() as a Context Manager)
some reasons when do in this way:
    - You only want to mock an object for a part of the test scope.
    - You are already using too many decorators or parameters, which hurts your testâ€™s readability.
